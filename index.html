                <h3>Calculator</h3>
                <p>I'm creating a simple yet functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
                    The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, 
                    multiplication, and division) with a clean and responsive design. It's a great project to 
                    showcase my skills in web development, highlighting my ability to combine structure 
                    (HTML), styling (CSS), and interactivity (JavaScript).

                <h3>Figma web UI</h3>
                <p>In this project, I designed a clean and modern web user interface using Figma. The goal was
                     to create a user-friendly and visually appealing design that focuses on functionality and aesthetics. 
                     I applied principles of layout, typography, and color theory to ensure the design aligns with current
                      web standards and trends. Throughout the process, I paid close attention to responsive design, ensuring
                       the interface adapts seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.

                <p>In this project, I designed a responsive image gallery using Figma, focusing on a clean, grid-based 
                    layout with intuitive hover effects and smooth transitions.
                     The design adapts well across devices, ensuring an engaging and user-friendly experience.
